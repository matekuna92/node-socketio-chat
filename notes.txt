npm install --save-dev jasmine

1. create spec folder:
./node_modules/.bin/jasmine init
2. package.json -> change "test" script to jasmine
3. npm test -> tests located in the spec folder as .spec.js files
4. npm install --save-dev request -> cant write http request natively in tests, package needed
